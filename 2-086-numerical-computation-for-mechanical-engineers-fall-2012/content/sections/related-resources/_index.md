[2.007 Design and Manufacturing I](/courses/2-007-design-and-manufacturing-i-spring-2009/) is a first subject in engineering design, including a [famed competition](http://video.mit.edu/channel/2-007/) among student-designed robots.

The concepts and techniques that students learn in 2.086 can be directly applied in the 2.007 design challenge.
